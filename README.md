# learning graphql in 2023

A simple CRUD web app which runs on an express server
where the graphql resolvers and type definitions exist.
With a client side web SPA. Also, to debug we have a studio app without CORS handling
to speed up things and compare GraphQL using Apollo Server/Client vs SWR with Restful services.
